Contao Filepicker Uuid
=====================

Small Contao extension to automatically convert file paths to `{{file::*}}` insert tags in certain DCA fields, e.g. all `url` and `imageUrl` fields. This way file references stay consistent, even if you move the file via the file manager.

This functionality is built into Contao already as of Contao `4.4.0`.
